# SkyLink Customer Churn Analysis
### Project Overview
This project involves analyzing the churn rates of customers for a telecommunication company called SkyLink. The goal is to understand the factors that contribute to customer churn and to provide actionable insights that can help SkyLink reduce their churn rate. The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Power BI, and a detailed interactive report was created to visualize the findings.

### Dataset
The analysis was based on a dataset provided by SkyLink, which includes information about customer demographics, service usage, contract details, payment methods, and customer service interactions. Additionally, a metadata sheet was provided that includes definitions of each column in the dataset.

### Key Objectives
Determine the current churn rate and identify the most prevalent churn category.
Analyze churn rates across different states and identify the state with the highest churn rate.
Examine the churn rate for different age groups and understand the relationship between age and churn.
Identify the group size that has the lowest churn rate among customers in groups.
Compare churn rates based on different contract types (One Year, Two Year, and Month-to-Month).
Evaluate the impact of unlimited data plans on churn rate and data consumption.
Investigate the effect of customers' international activity on churn.
Explore the relationship between payment methods, contract types, and customer tenure with churn.
Determine the churn rate for specific customer segments, such as those not in a group plan, aged 50+, with an account length of 12 months or less.
Provide insights from customer service call data to help SkyLink understand service-related issues contributing to churn.
Analyze the average number of customer service calls and churn rate for customers with a monthly contract and direct debit payment method.
Provide insights regarding additional charges (Extra International Charges & Extra Data Charges).
Calculate the average extra data charges for customers who are not on an unlimited data plan and consumed 10 or more GB.

### Findings
Current Churn Rate: The churn rate stands at 26.85%, with the most prevalent churn segment being those customers who transitioned to competitors.
State Analysis: California (CA) was identified as the state with the highest churn rate.
Age Group Analysis: Older age groups (65 years and above) show a higher churn rate compared to younger age groups.
Group Size: Group 6 had the lowest churn rate among customers in groups, indicating effective strategies for customer retention in that group.
Contract Type: Month-to-month contracts exhibited the highest churn rate, while biennial contracts had the lowest.
Unlimited Data Plans: Customers on unlimited data plans showed higher data consumption but were also more likely to churn.
International Activity: Higher international activity correlated with an increased likelihood of churn.
Payment Methods and Contract Types: Month-to-month contracts and paper check payments were associated with higher churn rates.
Customer Service Calls: Frequent customer service calls were linked to higher churn rates, indicating potential customer dissatisfaction.
Additional Charges: Higher additional charges were observed for customers who consumed more data but were not on an unlimited data plan.
